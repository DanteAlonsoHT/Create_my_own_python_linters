> This repository is about an example of how to build your own python linters from scratch using Ruby.

As you can see in this repository, the main idea is to create python linters, (**linters**) are the mean tool to analye the source code to detect programming errors, style flaws, bugs, suspucius code, etc.

## How to use it 📜

---

Follow the next steps to use this repository.

1.- Use your terminal and type `git clone 'link'` the repository:

    > git clone https://github.com/DanteAlonsoHT/Create_my_own_python_linters.git

2.- Once you got the repository in your local environment succed go ahead to stay inside the _"Create_my_own_python_linters"_ folder using `cd` in the terminal. <br>

    > cd Create_my_own_python_linters

3.- Before running the linters, firstable make sure you have your `file.py` into the `./test` folder, and it was named as `test.py`.

4.- Use the next command to run the python linters:

    > ruby .\bin\python_linters.rb

**Note:** Nothing appears if you don't have errors in your code, but if you have programming errors, you will see something like that:
